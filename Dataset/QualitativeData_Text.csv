1,1,"Weather is absolutely beautiful. A little breezy, not too sunny, just perfect! Was worried it would be cold!"
1,2,The clouds are looking extra nice… I know I tend to be observant of clouds but these ones really stand out to me. I like how it seems like a sheet covering the world.
1,3,The geese or ducks… whatever animal is in the picture… I am a little scared of them. I’m hesitant to walk close so I keep going in the grass to avoid any unwanted contact.
1,4,Two of them are strayed off from the rest… remind me of me and my best friend from home
1,5,The butterfly in the picture was so pretty. I saw some before but couldn’t get a picture fast enough. I had “pet” butterflies when I was little! They were monarchs… so cute.
1,6,A lot of bikers are out. People often run in pairs. I don’t think I could successfully hold a conversation while running so I am impressed every time I see that occur.
1,7,The water is really still. Nothing is out on it. It’s quite peaceful. I find it interesting how most things remind me of other things from home. Example: we have a small lake in my neighborhood where I used to visit often with my friends. This one is way bigger and is significantly more calm. Ours always had animals flying around and swimming in it.
1,8,"There aren’t many flowers… something I am missing. Maybe I haven’t gotten far enough yet, but the flowers I see are all the same. Pretty nonetheless."
1,9,"I am from a small rural town, so I really love having a view of buildings like this."
1,10,Was fascinated by how many (geese? ducks?) there are. They tend to stay together in groups and waddle around as one.
1,11,"If you look very, very closely at one of the flowers, there is a pretty, white butterfly!"
2,12,People in graduation cap and gowns are taking pictures with the Rhett statue

2,17,These cars are going really fast under the overhead bridge and are so so loud!
2,18,There’s rowing teams on the river that are practicing back and forth. Pretty sure they’re BU teams!
2,19,Sound of rowing speaker phone

2,32,"I just saw that one of the sailing boats almost ‘fell’ while turning. Maybe it’s on purpose, who knows?"
2,33,I see a couple running with their baby in a stroller.
2,34,"There was a man on a cool bike with a basket in the front, and sunglasses on."
2,35,A guy is trying to read a book by the water but is actually looking at his phone. So very distracted.
2,36,Outdoor gym!
2,37,Took some water and sun pictures by the cool floating place for people to sit (don’t know what it’s called– maybe a boardwalk?)
2,38,Geese apparently move their necks in a rapid back and forth motion while eating! I hadn’t really thought about it.
2,39,White flowers are blooming on this shrub like it’s spring.
2,40,"Damn! A man on a motorized unicycle was on his phone. No way, I’ve never seen that before. Had a helmet on though."
2,41,A dude was whistling loudly on his walk.
2,42,Fall colors are coming in!! Woohoo! Just the entire park is pretty

2,45,I keep stepping on lots of acorns as I walk.
3,46,"Lots of Canada Geese in the area, some of them are grooming their feathers or lying down, others look like they’re maybe foraging for food"
3,47,They (geese) were surprisingly unafraid of people: I passed right next to some of themand they didn’t even budge
3,48,Lots of trees lining the walkway
3,49,"Most of them (trees) are still green, although I did notice a few that were starting to be tinged yellow"

3,56,Most of them are jogging or biking
3,57,I saw one person skating using some kind of pole looking things
3,58,"Two people are sitting on a bench, they look like they’re working or studying"
3,59,Some people sitting on benches looking like they’re just admiring the view
3,60,Someone walking somewhere looking like they’re in a hurry and in business casual dress. Maybe they’re late to work?
3,61,"2 kayakers with sunhats on, looking like they’re enjoying the sunny weather"
3,62,A few people (teams?) rowing on the Charles River. They’re chanting/singing some kind of song
3,63,The city skyline against the Charles River looks really beautiful
3,64,"Especially cool because to my right (towards BU), it’s all rustic, older buildings, but to my left (across the river) there’s a bunch of modern, skyscraper type buildings"
3,65,Cool combination of old and new
3,66,Super cute little black and brown corgi running alongside their owner who’s on a bike
3,67,Also saw a man with his dog on a bench. He was trying to get the leash on his dog but the dog just kept trying to move around and lick his face instead (adorable!)

3,69,A few colorful/abstract murals on the side of a bridge and on the columns of the bridge

4,79,A lot of people walking
4,80,Even more running
4,81,Super sunny and warm conditions
4,82,People sitting down admiring nature
4,83,Dogs running around seem happy
4,84,Landscape view of the city from the esplanade looks like a photograph
4,85,Everything looks still-despite all the movement
4,86,Feels like “a call before the storm”
4,87,People seem to be enjoying the sunny day in October
4,88,My assumption is that people are trying to get some sun and nature in during their lunch breaks from work
4,89,A lot of geese around
4,90,Feels like a summer day
4,91,Trees are still their summer green color

4,93,Doesn’t look as if nature is in October
4,94,River is extremely calm

6,121,Very detailed graffiti of skulls underneath bridge
6,122,Someone biking past me carrying a big skeleton on his back
6,123,Person wearing neon LED equipment on a motorized unicycle
6,124,"A blurry photo of the person on the unicycle, not very clear since I had to quickly pull out my phone before they sped off at what must have been 20 miles per hour. They were turning and controlling very smoothly, so I would assume they are an experienced driver."
7,125,"Right from the start I noticed lots of bikers, runners, and walkers"
7,126,"I could hear the fast cars on the highway, but for some reason I started to forget I was in the city (probably due to the benches, grass, and trees present)"
7,127,In the distance I could also hear nearby planes flying in the sky

7,133,"Every once and a while I could hear birds chirping, but it was faint and quiet (sometimes hard to hear due to the highway)"
7,134,"These Geese were everywhere! It was a little scary, because they came so close, but they did not mean any harm and were just snooping in the grass."

10,155,The leaves on the trees were mainly green and now yellow or orange; there was very little wind and everything seemed still and calm
10,156,I walked by a dock; About 5 different couples were sitting on it looking out into the water
10,157,A man was fishing on the bridge and another man was crouched down near the rocks fishing
10,158,"I looked up into the sky and saw three helicopters in the air. They didn’t seem like they were moving, just floating in space"
10,159,"The foundation of the bridge I went under had paintings of different birds (one looked like a goose, the other looked like an eagle??)"
10,160,I walked by two willow trees near each other: one looked half alive and half dead and the other was lying horizontally on the ground
10,161,Pictured: The two willow trees I passed; The one on the left appears half healthy half dead and the one on the right has fallen over.
10,162,"Under the bridge, the pillar has an eagle drawn on it and the one in front of it had a goose (this caught my eye - do these birds mean something?)"
11,163,"I first notice the piles and piles of acorns on the sides of the overpass, tumbling and cracking as bikes ride over them or as I step on them. They roll around, hard shells making noises against the concrete."
11,164,"All along the trail people are weaving around each other, bikes and scooters passing those of us walking."
11,165,"I see a mural and art with birds, butterflies, flowers, patterns, beautiful in a space that is rusted and supposed to be ugly because it’s a water/electricity box."
11,166,"A hoard of geese ahead, splitting slowly to either side of the pass as people move through them"
11,167,"I walked out to the dock, found an emptied bottle of alcohol and geese poop, discarded food and trash from the time kids spent out there during late nights."
11,168,The dock swayed its weight which each step I took outward.
11,169,"Looking at the “desire paths” next to the paved walkway, showing where people habitually walk to avoid others or move on dirt rather than concrete."
11,170,Bikes and scooters quickly whiz around geese and people at a dangerous speed
11,171,"Straight ahead on the path before it curves, an opening of the guardrail opens straight to the highway, if you were to keep walking straight you would walk right onto Storrow drive."
11,172,"I walk over to a fallen tree in the water, that instead is split in two directions, hanging together by a small branch across the middle"
11,173,"Another strip of mural, narrowing the path to be right along the water and highway"
11,174,"I see the exit off Storrow drive I always take, looking at it from a completely new angle"
11,175,"Noticing people's litter, little pink feathers and trash like crushed cups, cigarettes, straws, package mailers, shake shack bags."
11,176,"I notice people have graffiti’d over the murals, but that it’s been painted over to preserve the original art"
11,177,"I notice a squirrel perched behind on a bench, peering over anxiously"
11,178,"Goose looks elegant for a moment, slowly blinking its eyes in the sunlight while resting"
11,179,I wonder how the geese and ducks get onto the dock from the water as i see a group of them swimming over
11,180,A crack in the mural below Storrow drive where a plant has poked through. I loved it’s positioning in the lighter blue circle.
11,181,The exit I would take off of Storrow Drive from growing up in the Boston area. It was very interesting to see it from the opposite side.

12,185,It was a nice temperature to go for a walk so it was very relaxing
12,186,I had some good music going and started to listen to the sounds of my surroundings on top of that
12,187,I was very annoyed at the road noise
12,188,All of these runners are making me feel like I should be running
12,189,They are now reminding me of why I don’t like running
12,190,I miss biking at home
12,191,Ended at 4:03
12,192,"Below is my photo. I have no idea what it is, or what it is used for, which is why I chose it. I spent longer than I should have analyzing it, but I came to no real conclusion about its purpose."
13,193,What does snow look like falling onto the river?
13,194,This looks like San Francisco Bay a little with the bridges in the background
13,195,"Somebody was in a hammock, and I immediately texted my parents asking them to bring my hammock family weekend"
13,196,Little brown weiner dog!
13,197,"Cute little dock: The water was really black around it, almost like oil. It might have just been the shadow though"
13,198,A bunch of grazing/sitting geese: no one sits on the benches near them
13,199,"Note: The time isn’t 30 minutes because I stopped to look at things a lot on the way there, and then didn’t really stop on the way back."
14,200,Many bikers and groups of runners
14,201,Geese along the walking trail (weren’t afraid of humans??)

14,209,"Super windy, scooping water out of their boats!!"
14,210,"I didn’t realize MIT was just across the river, so when I turned back from the esplanade, I decided to go on an adventure"
14,211,I made it to MIT! I rested in the shade in the middle of the main lawn and people watched MIT students come in and out of class
14,212,MIT students are surprisingly normal… overheard a conversation about quantum physics and then decided it was time for me to head back!!
15,213,October 8th 2:16 pm is when I began the walk. ( Walked for 20 minutes first way and 17 minutes the other way)
15,214,The first thing I notice are the rustling leaves being thrown around by the wind.
15,215,"I also see an array of joggers and runners running up and down the path resembling the different positions, directions and speeds of life different people are operating at all times."
15,216,A lot of cyclists either on a Blue Bike or their own cycles zooming past the runners which to me put into emphasis the modern reliance on machinery that most people have.
15,217,Charles River seems like the one big mirror holding the view in place
15,218,The rampant noise of the city of Boston is a vivid noise as I walk along the path and now turn around to walk back.
15,219,"The sharp glare of a bunny straight into my eyes as we both try to break each other down, almost as if the bunny is trying to figure out whether I can perceive it."
15,220,"The Old Lady’s two Dogs walking in unison , showing that friendship and strong bond that dogs have within family and a sense of loyalty which they possess in their behavior."
15,221,The sudden stark contrast between the smell of tobacco and a flower garden acts as the multicultural city of Boston and how there is a diverse community amongst us.
15,222,"The contrasting minds, body languages, vibes and people in general walking past each other for the first and last times in their lives probably each thinking about something different is what emphasizes why different kinds of minds are so interesting."
16,223,"A Large group of bikers wearing similar clothing came along. They don't seem to be extremely impressed by the view into the water when they all stop there to take a break. They must be from here, accustomed to the pretty view."
16,224,"A harmony of the water and wind, mixed with traffic from the nearby streets. Perfectly reflects the connection between city and nature in this park."
16,225,"It's not crowded here at all. I’m suppressed essentially everyone spends their time in the busy crowded city, and not in this peaceful park just minutes away."
16,226,I need to come here more often
16,227,"A moment overseeing the river and skyline, surrounded by nature from the park."
17,228,Sitting down on bench near the road and overpass
17,229,Slightly windy and cold
17,230,"2 geese are in the little open space, one goose is standing on one leg? Can they do that"
17,231,a man is walking on the muddy area right next to the walking pavement- there seems to be a hollow already throughout the path
17,232,humans create their own pathways in nature- negative environmental effects- grass and soil deteriorating
17,233,a boy walking with it appears to be his grandfather- small glances between each other
17,234,the geese fly away low to the ground squawking - that would’ve definitely hit someone
17,235,a man electric scooters past
17,236,a girl on the bench near me is working on school work
17,237,"for the runners going past, the outfits range from fleeces and sweatpants to a sports bra and biker shorts as well as the pace"
17,238,two twenty something girls just started their run with an “omg I can’t believe he did that”
17,239,someone in a teal unicycle just wobbled by
17,240,"the runners and i glance at each other, no communication"
17,241,the playground is empty on a tuesday morning/midday
17,242,the trees are sporadically placed with many different kinds
17,243,did not know about this overpass before and now I think it seems a good study spot
17,244,cloudy day and a slight chill seems perfect for a run along the charles river
18,245,"It’s really starting to feel like fall now, which I very much appreciate and enjoy since fall is my favorite season"
18,246,It's my favorite type of weather!
18,247,"people are out walking, running, or riding bikes on this beautiful October day"
18,248,people in boats rowing along the Charles River
18,249,Autumnal colored leaves scattered on path and actively falling off trees
18,250,"I like crunching them [leaves] as I walk, very satisfying"
18,251,Brings me back to my childhood
18,252,"Some trees are starting to turn yellow and orange, but most still green"
18,253,Cute little daisies lining the path
18,254,Makes me happy! [daisies]
18,255,Giant yellow mushroom that looks like it came out of a fantasy novel (pictured below)
18,256,It smells like fall!!
18,257,Smell of grass and woodsy scent
18,258,Carries especially on the crisp autumn air
18,259,More animals than I expected!
18,260,Lots of geese that proved to be sort of problematic (pictured and explained below)
18,261,Squirrels chasing each other up trees
18,262,"Ducks!!! I love ducks, especially mallard ducks like the ones I saw"
18,263,"The scenery of the Charles River with the skyline behind it is beautiful, especially from this one bridge I came across (pictured below)"
18,264,"The giant mushroom that looks like it came straight out of a fairytale, but the picture doesn’t do a good job of conveying just how massive this was."
18,265,"Okay funny story about this picture. As I was walking, there was a lady in front of me also walking. Out of nowhere these two geese swoop down directly in front of her and cut her off. It looked like a helicopter landing: leaves went everywhere, dust flew up in the air, and they cleared out their area of impact. The poor lady had to jump back so the geese didn’t hit her, and then they proceeded to stand right in our way and only moved after a good 10 second staring contest."
18,266,"A picture from the secluded bridge, you can see the leaves drifting in the water and right underneath the bridge there were ducks swimming (mallard ducks, my favorite)."
